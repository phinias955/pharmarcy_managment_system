# pharmarcy_managment_system
The main aim of the project is the management of the database of the pharmaceutical shop. This project is insight into the design and implementation of a Pharmacy Management System. This is done by creating a database of the available medicines in the shop. The primary aim of pharmacy management system is to improve accuracy and enhance safety and efficiency in the pharmaceutical store. The aim of this project is to develop software for the effective management of a pharmaceutical store. We have developed this software for ensuring effective policing by providing statistics of the drugs in stock.
Description on the topic:
This program can be used in any pharmaceutical shops having a database to maintain. The software used can generate reports, as per the user‚Äôs requirements. The software can print invoices, bills, receipts etc. It can also maintain the record of supplies sent in by the supplier. Here, the admin who are handling the organization will be responsible to manage the record of the employee. Each employee will be given with a separate username and password.
Problem Definition:

Pharmacy management system deals with the maintenance of drugs and consumables in the pharmacy unit. This pharmacy management system is user friendly.

By using MySQL commands and its database this software of Pharmacy management tends to store all the data received from the users including drugs sales details and the profit made by the owners are all in this data base. This website allows the user to generate invoices for sales, check expiry and quantity remaining of the drugs. It also provides user with options to renew validity and add more drugs into the store and update the database accordingly. By using xampp server these database commands are easily initiated into the database and the ER diagram with relational schema diagrams helps us to make the structure of the database faster and it was easier to make them understand the needs of the website.
